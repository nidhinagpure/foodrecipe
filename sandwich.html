    <h3><b><i>How to make Potato Sandwich</i></b></h3> 

    <div>
        <h2>Step 1</h2>
        <p>First rinse 2 to 3 medium sized potatoes thoroughly in water.<br>
             Then boil or steam them until fork tender in a pan, <br>
             or pressure cooker or Instant pot.<br><br>

            When the potatoes have become warm then peel them.<br>
             Mash the boiled potatoes in a mixing bowl. <br>
             You can mash them with a fork or a potato masher.<br>
             Mix well. Taste the stuffing and add more salt if needed. 
        </p>

        <h2>Step 2</h2>
        <p> 
            Take 8 to 10 bread slices on a chopping board.<br>
             Spread softened butter generously on them.<br>
             Place some of the spiced potato stuffing on the buttered bread slices.<br><br>

            To make these sandwiches spicy and more flavorsome <br>
            you can opt to spread some coriander chutney or <br>
            mint chutney on the butter.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Step 3 </h2>
        <p> Top with grated cheese if required. You can use cheddar cheese<br>
             or processed cheese or mozzarella cheese. <br>
             Or a mix of cheddar and mozzarella cheese. I have used cheddar cheese.<br><br>

            If you are not fond of cheese then you can skip adding them.<br>
             The addition of cheese makes the sandwich more filling.

        <h2>Step 4  </h2>
        <p> 
            Cover with the remaining buttered bread slices.<br>
             Spread butter lightly on the top of the slices.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 5 </h2>
        <p>In a pre heated grill or panini press, <br>
            place the aloo sandwich carefully with the buttered side facing down,<br>
             making sure your hands don't touch the grill. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Step 6 </h2>
        <p> 
            Grill for 2 to 3 minutes or until sandwiches are crisp,<br>
            golden and toasted well. Assemble and grill the<br>
             remaining sandwiches this way.grilled potato sandwich

    </div>
    <div> 
        <h2>Step 7 </h2>
        <P> Serve potato sandwich hot or warm with tomato ketchup or <br>
            coriander chutney or mint chutney or any dipping sauce of your choice.<br><br>

            These sandwiches don't become soggy and <br>
            they can be packed for short journeys or lunch box.<br>
             Just remember to omit the cheese if packing for short journeys or lunch box.</P>
